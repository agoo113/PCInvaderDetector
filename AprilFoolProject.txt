April Fool project is an inspiration from PCInvaderDetector to prank my friend.

You just need to run main.py in AprilFoolClient and enable the attack on webserver.
Any time you move your keyboard or click mouse, the screen will lock down and the wallpaper will be changed very quickly. 
After disable the attack, pop up boxes will come up and block the screen.
